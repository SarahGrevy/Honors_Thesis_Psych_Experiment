<div>&nbsp;</div>
Philosophers and psychologists have studied moral dilemmas for many years, tackling questions such as the role of emotion and reason when making moral decisions (e.g., Kant, 1959; Haidt et al., 2001), the importance of knowing intentions and outcomes (e.g., Cushman, 2008), the dyadic nature of morality (e.g., Gray et al, 2012), and the neurophysiological correlates of moral judgment (e.g., Greene et al., 2001). In this study, we examined the flexibility of moral judgment by investigating how evaluative modes, motivations (e.g. mindsets, roles, uncertainty, and/or self-construal), and social contexts impact judgments and behaviors in the moral domain. The study is designed to learn more about how the way in which we view different stimuli or perform different tasks is affected and/or affects our evaluations, motivations, behaviors, and neurophysiological responses. In particular, we are interested in the role of identities and social contexts as dynamic forces that shape moral jdugments. Uncovering such forces is critical to understanding small and large-scale social relations. To achieve this end, you viewed a series of stimuli under one of a few cognitive mindsets or social contexts and then evaluated / performed behavioral tasks. You may have also been placed under cognitive load to either increase or attenuate the observed effects.

We hypothesize that a given cognitive mindset or social context will impact participants' judgments, decisions, and behavior in the moral domain (e.g., a primed group identity amplifying moral outrage experienced by participants and increasing their tendencies toward moralizing behaviors). By investigating how such mindsets and contexts dynamically shape moral judgments over time, we can conclude the relative importance of such mindsets or contexts. In addition, by holding the stimuli or behavioral tasks constant, we can conclude that any observed differences are in fact due to the induced mode of evaluative processing. For some participants, the independent variable is the induced evaluative mode (e.g. individual and/or group level self-construal; certainty vs. uncertainty) while for others we simply observed how judgments / behaviors unfolded over time as part of a social context. The dependent variables may have included the categorization of morally ambiguous actions as either moral or amoral, solving moral dilemmas, making taboo-tradeoffs, the speed of judgments, the extremity of judgments, the universality of judgments, affective reactions, and neurophysiological measures. Results will be analyzed using multiple regression analyses.
